#### **üí° Business Insights \& Recommendations**





##### ‚úÖ Observations and Business Recommendations



1Ô∏è‚É£ Observation: Popular Product Combinations Identified



Finding:



Top frequent itemsets show high support for combinations like:



"WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER"



"JUMBO BAG RED RETROSPOT"





Recommendation:



* Create product bundles or combo packs for these popular items.
* Promote them on the homepage or in-store displays as ‚ÄúMost Loved Combos.‚Äù





2Ô∏è‚É£ Observation: High Lift Rules Highlight Strong Cross-Sell Opportunities



Finding:



Rules such as:



"ALARM CLOCK BAKELIKE GREEN" ‚Üí "ALARM CLOCK BAKELIKE RED"



Lift Value: 24.03





Recommendation:



* Offer special bundle discounts for these combinations.
* Place these items next to each other in physical stores or add ‚ÄúFrequently Bought Together‚Äù sections online.





3Ô∏è‚É£ Observation: Single Item Dominance in Frequent Itemsets



Finding:



Some items appear repeatedly in multiple frequent itemsets as antecedents.





Recommendation:



* Treat these as anchor products in upselling strategies.
* Always suggest complementing products with anchor products on checkout pages.





4Ô∏è‚É£ Observation: Certain Item Combinations Have High Confidence but Low Support



Finding:



Example rule:



"SET/6 RED SPOTTY PAPER PLATES" ‚Üí "SET/6 RED SPOTTY PAPER CUPS"



Confidence: 0.75



Support: Low (<1%)





Recommendation:



* Focus marketing efforts on niche or targeted customer segments.
* Use personalized email campaigns rather than general homepage promotions.





5Ô∏è‚É£ Observation: Products with Low Lift \& Low Confidence Exist



Finding:



Some rules have lift values close to 1.0, meaning no strong association.





Recommendation:



* Avoid prioritizing these combinations in bundling or marketing.
* Consider reviewing inventory and reducing stock for such slow-moving pairs.
